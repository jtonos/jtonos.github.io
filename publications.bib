	abstract = {The ascomycete Geosmithia morbida and the walnut twig beetle Pityophthorus juglandis are associated with thousand cankers disease of Juglans (walnut) and Pterocarya (wingnut). The disease was first reported in the western United States ({USA}) on several Juglans species, but has been found more recently in the eastern {USA} in the native range of the highly susceptible Juglans nigra. We performed a comprehensive population genetic study of 209 G. morbida isolates collected from Juglans and Pterocarya from 17 geographic regions distributed across 12 U.S. states. The study was based on sequence typing of 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms from three genomic regions and genotyping with ten microsatellite primer pairs. Using multilocus sequence-typing data, 197 G. morbida isolates were placed into one of 57 haplotypes. In some instances, multiple haplotypes were recovered from isolates collected on the same tree. Twenty-four of the haplotypes (42\%) were recovered from more than one isolate; the two most frequently occurring haplotypes (H02 and H03) represented 36\% of all isolates. These two haplotypes were abundant in California, but were not recovered from Arizona or New Mexico. G. morbida population structure was best explained by four genetically distinct groups that clustered into three geographic regions. Most of the haplotypes isolated from the native range of J. major (Arizona and New Mexico) were found in those states only or present in distinct genetic clusters. There was no evidence of sexual reproduction or genetic recombination in any population. The scattered distribution of the genetic clusters indicated that G. morbida was likely disseminated to different regions at several times and from several sources. The large number of haplotypes observed and the genetic complexity of G. morbida indicate that it evolved in association with at least one Juglans spp. and the walnut twig beetle long before the first reports of the disease.},

Yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild, but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban “population” had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations, and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations.},

Examples of diversiﬁcation arising from mutualisms and antagonisms at diﬀerent trophic levels are scarce, which limits our understanding on how complex relationships between species arise within communities. By adopting a cophylogenetic framework, we investigated whether congruence in plant-lemur phylogenies are driven by mutualisms and antagonisms in Madagascar, where endemic species have evolved within a unique isolated biogeographical context. Although we found weak support for coevolution, this is not to say that lemurs and plants did not share evolutionary history. Weak cophylogenetic signals do not necessarily imply lack of co-diversiﬁcation. Rather, our results suggest that vertebrates and plants inﬂuenced each other evolution, but in a multi-speciﬁc context where the cophylogenetic process leaded to spatio-temporal asymmetries and shifts between periods of coevolution and independent evolution, ultimately resulting in a weak, continuous and diﬀuse process.},

            Biotic interactions, such as plant–animal seed dispersal mutualisms, are essential for ecosystem function. Such interactions are threatened by the possible extinction of the animal partners. Using a data set that includes plant–lemur interactions across Madagascar, we studied the current state of knowledge of these interactions and their structure to determine which plant species are most at risk of losing dispersal services due to the loss of lemurs. We found substantial gaps in understanding of plant–lemur interactions; data were substantially skewed toward a few lemur species and locations. There was also a large gap in knowledge on the interactions of plants and small‐bodied or nocturnal lemurs and lemurs outside a few highly studied locations. Of the recorded interactions, a significant portion occurred between lemurs and endemic plants, rather than native or introduced plants. We also found that lemur species tended to primarily consume closely related plant species. Such interaction patterns may indicate the threats to Malagasy endemic plants and highlight how lemur population loss or reductions could affect plant phylogenetic diversity. When examining the impacts of lemur extinction, losing critically endangered species left 164 plant species with no known lemur frugivore partners. Despite phylogenetic patterns in lemur diet, plants for which the only known lemur frugivore is critically endangered were not closely related. These results emphasize the need for further studies to complete our knowledge on these essential interactions and to inform conservation priorities.

              Análisis de la estructura de las interacciones entre lémures y plantas de cara al conocimiento incompleto
              
                Resumen
                Las interacciones bióticas, como el mutualismo entre plantas y animales para la dispersión de semillas, son esenciales para que el ecosistema funcione. Dichas interacciones se encuentran amenazadas por la posible extinción del animal que participa en ellas. Usamos un conjunto de datos que incluye las interacciones entre lémures y plantas en Madagascar para estudiar el estado actual del conocimiento de estas interacciones y su estructura. Con lo anterior determinamos cuáles especies botánicas tienen mayor riesgo de perder la dispersión de semillas debido a la extinción de los lémures. Encontramos vacíos sustanciales en el entendimiento de las interacciones entre lémures y plantas; los datos estaban sesgados para unas cuantas especies de lémures y localidades. Hubo un gran vacío de conocimiento para las interacciones entre las plantas y los lémures pequeños o nocturnos y aquellos fuera de unas cuantas localidades estudiadas. De las interacciones registradas, una porción importante ocurrió entre los lémures y plantas endémicas, en lugar de plantas nativas o introducidas. También encontramos que las especies de lémures tienden a consumir especies botánicas con filogenia cercana. Dichos patrones de interacción podrían indicar las amenazas para las plantas endémicas de Madagascar y enfatizar cómo la pérdida o reducción de las poblaciones de lémures podrían afectar la diversidad filogenética de las plantas. Cuando examinamos el impacto de la extinción de los lémures, la pérdida de especies en peligro crítico dejó a 164 especies de plantas sin un lémur frugívoro mutualista. A pesar de los patrones filogenéticos en la dieta de los lémures, las plantas cuyo único lémur frugívoro se encuentra en peligro crítico no tienen una filogenia cercana. Estos resultados resaltan la necesidad de más estudios para completar nuestro conocimiento sobre estas interacciones esenciales y para guiar las prioridades de conservación.

              【摘要】生物相互作用(如植物‐动物种子传播的互惠过程)对生态系统功能至关重要, 而动物潜在的灭绝风险会对这些相互作用造成威胁。本研究利用马达加斯加各地植物与狐猴之间相互作用的数据集, 分析了这些相互作用及其结构的知识现状, 以确定哪些植物物种最有可能因狐猴灭绝而失去种子传播服务。我们发现在理解植物‐狐猴相互作用方面仍存在巨大空缺, 已有数据严重偏向于少数狐猴物种和地点, 而在植物与小体型狐猴、夜行性狐猴以及在少数研究较多地点以外的狐猴之间的相互作用方面, 仍有明显的知识空缺。已有记载的相互作用很大一部分发生在狐猴与特有植物之间, 而非本地或外来引进的植物。此外, 狐猴物种往往主要食用系统发育关系相近的植物物种。这种相互作用格局表明马达加斯加的特有植物可能面临威胁, 并突出了狐猴种群灭绝或数量下降对植物系统发育多样性的影响。在研究狐猴灭绝的影响时, 我们还发现, 当极度濒危的狐猴物种灭绝后, 有164种植物物种会失去所有已知的果食性狐猴伙伴。尽管狐猴的食性存在系统发育相似性, 但唯一已知的果食性狐猴伙伴已极度濒危的植物物种却并不相近。以上结果强调了通过深入研究来增进对这些重要相互作用的认识以指导优先保护的必要性。

	abstract = {In tropical forests, most plant species rely on frugivorous animals for seed dispersal services. Such mutualisms are imperiled by defaunation, which disproportionately affects large-bodied vertebrates and may impact the interactions of the large-seeded plants they disperse. However, frugivore-mediated seed dispersal (zoochory) may not be the only mechanism ensuring the dispersal of a given plant species. With a focus on large-seeded canopy trees in the genus Canarium in the rainforests of Madagascar, thought to be dispersed by large-bodied lemur species, we investigated the contribution of multiple dispersal mechanisms to the movement of large seeds. Specifically, we (1) examined the potential for dispersal by abiotic factors, such as winds and runoff associated with frequent cyclones, (2) documented the animal species that could effectively contribute to their primary and secondary seed dispersal, and (3) determined how non-lemur and abiotic dispersal compare to the imperiled function of extant, though threatened, lemur primary dispersers. Using field observations and experiments, we found that wind, water, and secondary dispersal can move seeds considerable distances away from the parent plants, though they were less effective at long-distance dispersal than primary dispersers (i.e., large-bodied lemurs). For secondary dispersal, we found that dispersal distance is positively correlated with predation, potentially reducing dispersal effectiveness. Future comparisons with predation of primary or abiotically dispersed seeds will be necessary. Our research highlights the role of understudied mechanisms in the dispersal of large-seeded plants in Madagascar. Understanding the existence and impact of non-lemur dispersers in these imperiled forests can help complete our understanding of the mechanisms that shaped their astounding biodiversity and may mediate their response to ongoing environmental change.},

Characterizing the dispersal mechanism of such plant species can provide insights about their population dynamics and regeneration. We investigated the effectiveness of the extant fauna as seed dispersers of the Malagasy baobab, Adansonia grandidieri, which have megafaunal dispersal traits. We documented the animal species that interact with its fruits and seeds in the canopy and on the ground through direct observations, camera trapping, opportunistic search of feces with seeds, and dispersal experiments. We also estimated seed fate using a model parameterized with data obtained through experiments on seed removal and seed germination under and away from adult A. grandidieri trees. Further, we examined the impacts of seed dispersal in mitigating herbivore pressures on A. grandidieri seedling through an exclosure experiment. We did not find animals interacting with fruits in the canopy. However, we observed a native rodent species, Eliurus myoxinus, handling fruits/seeds on the ground, and found seeds in bush pig feces. Also, while the rates of germination for the dispersed A. grandidieri seeds were low, their probability of producing viable seedlings was higher than when the seeds stayed under adult trees. We also found that the seedlings of A. grandidieri had a high probability of surviving even when herbivores were present. Overall, our results provide insights into the regeneration of A. grandidieri and suggest that some extant local ground-­dwelling fauna can provide seed dispersal services to this species.},

                  The movement decisions of frugivores shape spatial patterns of seed deposition, with considerable impacts for plant individuals, populations and communities.
                
                
                  However, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms determining the foraging strategies behind the movements of frugivorous animals and their interaction with the landscape.
                
                
                  
                    Using spatially explicit simulations we examined the movements and seed dispersal of red‐bellied lemur (
                    Eulemur rubriventer
                    ) groups dispersing seeds of the tropical tree
                    Harungana madagascariensis
                    under four theorized foraging strategies.
                  
                
                
                  These included scenarios in which frugivores move directly to the (1) most rewarding plant in the landscape, (2) nearest fruiting plant, or towards the most rewarding plant in the landscape, with stops at any fruiting plants encountered along the way according to a local attraction distance of (3) 10 m and (4) 20 m.
                
                
                  We then compared 12 metrics and data distributions for seed dispersal and movement patterns from these models to empirical observations.
                
                
                  Simulations of foraging strategies with directed movement towards highly rewarding resources (strategy 1) produced the longest seed dispersal distances and best matched observed patterns.
                
                
                  Observed data of lemur movements and directionality best matched results from three strategies, simulations towards highly rewarding resources without stops (strategy 1) and with either stops along the way with a 10 m (strategy 3) or 20 m (strategy 4) attraction distance.
                
                
                  Collectively, our results supported the strategies in which lemurs moved consistently towards the small number of trees that produced the most fruit in the landscape.
                
                
                  Our work supports incorporating a mechanistic understanding of animal foraging, movement behaviour and landscape patterns in fruit production for the prediction of seed movement. Explicit considerations of these mechanisms can improve our understanding of the maintenance and structure of diversity in plant communities, with implications for the conservation of forest ecosystems relying on animals for seed dispersal.
