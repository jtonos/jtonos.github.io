The Tonos lab is seeking a student to participate in an international research opportunity funded by a grant from the CSU Black Success Initiative. The selected student will work closely with Dr. Tonos to develop and plan a project over the Spring 2025 semester, conduct a field research project during a paid 1-month Madagascar field experience (160 hours at 18.26/hour = 2,987), and participate in data management, statistical analysis and scientific writing during the Fall 2025 semester (for research credit). Research will be focused on the study of mutualisms in the tropics, their structure, impacts on biodiversity and response to human activities.
Possible research topics may include:
1) assessment of understudied pollinators 2) use of genetic techniques to sample plant-frugivore interactions 3) study of bird-plant interactions in degraded forests and 4) effects of invasive guava fruiting season on lemur movement patterns.  
Minimum Requirements:

•	Demonstrated interest in a career in Ecology through coursework or volunteer, internship and work experiences
•	An understanding of the barriers faced by black students in academia and the positive impact undergraduate research experiences can have on minority student success and retention
•	Preference for Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors, but strong Freshmen applicants are encouraged 
•	Students must be planning to enroll full time for both the Spring 2025 and Fall 2025 semesters
o	Students graduating in Spring 2025 can only participate if interested in joining my lab as graduate students in the Fall of 2025. Reach out to discuss this option
