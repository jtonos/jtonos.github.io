        We study plant-animal interactions, with a particular focus on seed dispersal and frugivory. Many of our projects are geared towards documenting understudied interactions, assessing the structure of mutualisms at the individual-individual and species interaction levels, and examine how interactions are impacted by human-driven environmental change.
