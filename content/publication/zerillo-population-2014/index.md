abstract: The ascomycete Geosmithia morbida and the walnut twig beetle Pityophthorus
  juglandis are associated with thousand cankers disease of Juglans (walnut) and Pterocarya
  (wingnut). The disease was first reported in the western United States (USA) on
  several Juglans species, but has been found more recently in the eastern USA in
  the native range of the highly susceptible Juglans nigra. We performed a comprehensive
  population genetic study of 209 G. morbida isolates collected from Juglans and Pterocarya
  from 17 geographic regions distributed across 12 U.S. states. The study was based
  on sequence typing of 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms from three genomic regions
  and genotyping with ten microsatellite primer pairs. Using multilocus sequence-typing
  data, 197 G. morbida isolates were placed into one of 57 haplotypes. In some instances,
  multiple haplotypes were recovered from isolates collected on the same tree. Twenty-four
  of the haplotypes (42%) were recovered from more than one isolate; the two most
  frequently occurring haplotypes (H02 and H03) represented 36% of all isolates. These
  two haplotypes were abundant in California, but were not recovered from Arizona
  or New Mexico. G. morbida population structure was best explained by four genetically
  distinct groups that clustered into three geographic regions. Most of the haplotypes
  isolated from the native range of J. major (Arizona and New Mexico) were found in
  those states only or present in distinct genetic clusters. There was no evidence
  of sexual reproduction or genetic recombination in any population. The scattered
  distribution of the genetic clusters indicated that G. morbida was likely disseminated
  to different regions at several times and from several sources. The large number
  of haplotypes observed and the genetic complexity of G. morbida indicate that it
  evolved in association with at least one Juglans spp. and the walnut twig beetle
  long before the first reports of the disease.
