abstract: © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA). Yellowwood
  (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild,
  but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside
  its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states
  are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as
  an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore
  lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood
  for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared
  to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods
  from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with
  61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found
  that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban “population”
  had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating
  that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated
  wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations,
  and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations.
