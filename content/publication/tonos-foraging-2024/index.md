abstract: Abstract    The movement decisions of frugivores shape spatial patterns
  of seed deposition, with considerable impacts for plant individuals, populations
  and communities.   However, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms determining
  the foraging strategies behind the movements of frugivorous animals and their interaction
  with the landscape.    Using spatially explicit simulations we examined the movements
  and seed dispersal of red‐bellied lemur ( Eulemur rubriventer ) groups dispersing
  seeds of the tropical tree Harungana madagascariensis under four theorized foraging
  strategies.    These included scenarios in which frugivores move directly to the
  (1) most rewarding plant in the landscape, (2) nearest fruiting plant, or towards
  the most rewarding plant in the landscape, with stops at any fruiting plants encountered
  along the way according to a local attraction distance of (3) 10 m and (4) 20 m.   We
  then compared 12 metrics and data distributions for seed dispersal and movement
  patterns from these models to empirical observations.   Simulations of foraging
  strategies with directed movement towards highly rewarding resources (strategy 1)
  produced the longest seed dispersal distances and best matched observed patterns.   Observed
  data of lemur movements and directionality best matched results from three strategies,
  simulations towards highly rewarding resources without stops (strategy 1) and with
  either stops along the way with a 10 m (strategy 3) or 20 m (strategy 4) attraction
  distance.   Collectively, our results supported the strategies in which lemurs moved
  consistently towards the small number of trees that produced the most fruit in the
  landscape.   Our work supports incorporating a mechanistic understanding of animal
  foraging, movement behaviour and landscape patterns in fruit production for the
  prediction of seed movement. Explicit considerations of these mechanisms can improve
  our understanding of the maintenance and structure of diversity in plant communities,
  with implications for the conservation of forest ecosystems relying on animals for
  seed dispersal.     Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the
