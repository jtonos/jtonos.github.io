 abstract = {In tropical forests, most plant species rely on frugivorous animals for seed dispersal services. Such mutualisms are imperiled by defaunation, which disproportionately affects large-bodied vertebrates and may impact the interactions of the large-seeded plants they disperse. However, frugivore-mediated seed dispersal (zoochory) may not be the only mechanism ensuring the dispersal of a given plant species. With a focus on large-seeded canopy trees in the genus Canarium in the rainforests of Madagascar, thought to be dispersed by large-bodied lemur species, we investigated the contribution of multiple dispersal mechanisms to the movement of large seeds. Specifically, we (1) examined the potential for dispersal by abiotic factors, such as winds and runoff associated with frequent cyclones, (2) documented the animal species that could effectively contribute to their primary and secondary seed dispersal, and (3) determined how non-lemur and abiotic dispersal compare to the imperiled function of extant, though threatened, lemur primary dispersers. Using field observations and experiments, we found that wind, water, and secondary dispersal can move seeds considerable distances away from the parent plants, though they were less effective at long-distance dispersal than primary dispersers (i.e., large-bodied lemurs). For secondary dispersal, we found that dispersal distance is positively correlated with predation, potentially reducing dispersal effectiveness. Future comparisons with predation of primary or abiotically dispersed seeds will be necessary. Our research highlights the role of understudied mechanisms in the dispersal of large-seeded plants in Madagascar. Understanding the existence and impact of non-lemur dispersers in these imperiled forests can help complete our understanding of the mechanisms that shaped their astounding biodiversity and may mediate their response to ongoing environmental change.},
