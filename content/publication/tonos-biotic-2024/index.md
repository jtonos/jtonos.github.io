abstract: In tropical forests, most plant species rely on frugivorous animals for
  seed dispersal services. Such mutualisms are imperiled by defaunation, which disproportionately
  affects large-bodied vertebrates and may impact the interactions of the large-seeded
  plants they disperse. However, frugivore-mediated seed dispersal (zoochory) may
  not be the only mechanism ensuring the dispersal of a given plant species. With
  a focus on large-seeded canopy trees in the genus Canarium in the rainforests of
  Madagascar, thought to be dispersed by large-bodied lemur species, we investigated
  the contribution of multiple dispersal mechanisms to the movement of large seeds.
  Specifically, we (1) examined the potential for dispersal by abiotic factors, such
  as winds and runoff associated with frequent cyclones, (2) documented the animal
  species that could effectively contribute to their primary and secondary seed dispersal,
  and (3) determined how non-lemur and abiotic dispersal compare to the imperiled
  function of extant, though threatened, lemur primary dispersers. Using field observations
  and experiments, we found that wind, water, and secondary dispersal can move seeds
  considerable distances away from the parent plants, though they were less effective
  at long-distance dispersal than primary dispersers (i.e., large-bodied lemurs).
  For secondary dispersal, we found that dispersal distance is positively correlated
  with predation, potentially reducing dispersal effectiveness. Future comparisons
  with predation of primary or abiotically dispersed seeds will be necessary. Our
  research highlights the role of understudied mechanisms in the dispersal of large-seeded
  plants in Madagascar. Understanding the existence and impact of non-lemur dispersers
  in these imperiled forests can help complete our understanding of the mechanisms
  that shaped their astounding biodiversity and may mediate their response to ongoing
  environmental change.
