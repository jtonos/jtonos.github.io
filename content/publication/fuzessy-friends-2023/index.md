abstract: Coevolution played a central role in shaping biodiversity. However, coevolutionary
  events driving reciprocal diversiﬁcation between interacting partners lack empirical
  evidences. Examples of diversiﬁcation arising from mutualisms and antagonisms at
  diﬀerent trophic levels are scarce, which limits our understanding on how complex
  relationships between species arise within communities. By adopting a cophylogenetic
  framework, we investigated whether congruence in plant-lemur phylogenies are driven
  by mutualisms and antagonisms in Madagascar, where endemic species have evolved
  within a unique isolated biogeographical context. Although we found weak support
  for coevolution, this is not to say that lemurs and plants did not share evolutionary
  history. Weak cophylogenetic signals do not necessarily imply lack of co-diversiﬁcation.
  Rather, our results suggest that vertebrates and plants inﬂuenced each other evolution,
  but in a multi-speciﬁc context where the cophylogenetic process leaded to spatio-temporal
  asymmetries and shifts between periods of coevolution and independent evolution,
  ultimately resulting in a weak, continuous and diﬀuse process.
