Jadelys Tonos is an assitant profesor in the Department of Biology at San Francisco State University. Her research is focused on the study of mutualisms, seeking to document positive interactions in nature and examine their strucuture and resilience to human-driven environmental change. Much of her work to date has focused on examining patterns in frugivory and seed dispersal by lemurs in Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar. Ongoing and future work is focused on examining the role of poorly studied frugivores in Madagascar, assessing the impact of restoration efforts on plant-frugivore interactions in California, and examining the impact of climate change on the phenology of plants, birds and plnt-bird interactions in California.  

Growing up in Puerto Rico to Dominican parents Dr. Tonos learned english as a second language. Her interest in Ecology arose are an Undergraduate in Wildlife Biology student at Purdue University where she had first sought a pre-veterinary degree. Her experiences as a twice-immigrant, as a queer latina in STEM, and as an academic with dyslexcia heavily infleunces her approach to teaching, mentornship and science.
